        content: "The European Union's landmark Digital Markets Act (DMA) is set to take full effect, forcing the world's largest tech companies, designated as 'gatekeepers,' to overhaul some of their core business practices in Europe. The legislation compels giants like Apple to allow alternative app stores on iOS and Google to give users more choice in search and browser defaults. While regulators champion the DMA as a pro-consumer move to foster competition, the companies have cautioned that the changes could introduce new security risks and potentially fragment the user experience. The global tech industry is watching closely to see the long-term effects on innovation and market dynamics."

The subject, the Serpens Nebula, is located about 1,300 light-years from Earth. Webb's powerful infrared gaze pierces through the dense cosmic dust, revealing clusters of newly forming stars, some no more than a few hundred thousand years old. The image is particularly notable for capturing a grouping of protostellar outflows, where jets of gas are blasted into space from the poles of young stars, creating a dramatic celestial display."
